# Hop-Constrained-DFS
implementing and analyzing the algorithm of C-DFS &amp; T-DFS of the research paper (Efficient Hop-constrained s-t Simple Path Enumeration, VLDB 2021)

## The output
Here are some outputs and screenshots of the two algorithms with different cases: 
> edges in red represents the shortest path which is T-DFS
> edges in blue represents all paths which is C-DFS*

###### Case 1 :
